# OurScript
Communist Scrips. A script that follows the communist agenda.

Why OurScript you might ask?
Finaly! There is a programming language that true believers in the Communist Utopia can feel at home with.
We have things such as. No private variables, alocations, functions, or anything.
If it could have been private in other conventional, capitalist languages, it is not here.
variables are not allowed to have names that would indicate individuality or a seperation from the rest of the code, I, My.
All varibles, arrays, lists, strings, etc. allocate equal space in memory. Equality is a necessity.
